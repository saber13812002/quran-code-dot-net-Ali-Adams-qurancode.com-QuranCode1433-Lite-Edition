List of Perfect Numbers
-----------------------
The following is a list of the known perfect numbers, along with the Mersenne prime exponent p
which generates them with the expression 2^(p-1) * (2p - 1) where 2p - 1 is a Mersenne prime.

All even perfect numbers are of this form. It is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers.

The ratio p/digits ~= log(10)/log(4) = 1.660964...

The displayed ranks are among those perfect numbers which are known as of September 2016.
Some ranks may change later if smaller perfect numbers are discovered.
It is known there is no odd perfect number below 10^1500.[7] GIMPS reported that by 2 September 2016 the search for Mersenne primes (and thereby even perfect numbers) became exhaustive up to the 45th above.[8]



General Information
===================

All even perfect numbers have a very precise form; odd perfect numbers either do not exist or are rare. There are a number of results on perfect numbers that are actually quite easy to prove but nevertheless superficially impressive; some of them also come under Richard Guy's strong law of small numbers:

    The only even perfect number of the form x3 + 1 is 28 (Makowski 1962).[32]

    28 is the only even perfect number that is a sum of two positive integral cubes (Gallardo 2010).[33]

    The reciprocals of the divisors of a perfect number N must add up to 2 (to get this, take the definition of a perfect number, sigma 1 ( n ) = 2 n {\displaystyle \sigma _{1}(n)=2n} \sigma _{1}(n)=2n, and divide both sides by n):
        For 6, we have 1 / 6 + 1 / 3 + 1 / 2 + 1 / 1 = 2 {\displaystyle 1/6+1/3+1/2+1/1=2} 1/6+1/3+1/2+1/1=2;
        For 28, we have 1 / 28 + 1 / 14 + 1 / 7 + 1 / 4 + 1 / 2 + 1 / 1 = 2 {\displaystyle 1/28+1/14+1/7+1/4+1/2+1/1=2} 1/28+1/14+1/7+1/4+1/2+1/1=2, etc.

    The number of divisors of a perfect number (whether even or odd) must be even, because N cannot be a perfect square.[34]
    From these two results it follows that every perfect number is an Ore's harmonic number.

    The even perfect numbers are not trapezoidal numbers; that is, they cannot be represented as the difference of two positive non-consecutive triangular numbers. There are only three types of non-trapezoidal numbers: even perfect numbers, powers of two, and the numbers of the form 2 n - 1 ( 2 n + 1 ) {\displaystyle 2^{n-1}(2^{n}+1)} 2^{n-1}(2^{n}+1) formed as the product of a Fermat prime 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle 2^{n}+1} 2^{n}+1 with a power of two in a similar way to the construction of even perfect numbers from Mersenne primes.[35]

    The number of perfect numbers less than n is less than c n {\displaystyle c{\sqrt {n}}} c{\sqrt {n}}, where c > 0 is a constant.[36] In fact it is o ( n ) {\displaystyle o({\sqrt {n}})} o({\sqrt {n}}), using little-o notation.[37]

    Every even perfect number ends in 6 or 28, base ten; and, with the only exception of 6, ends in 1, base 9.[38][39] Therefore in particular the digital root of every even perfect number other than 6 is 1.

    The only square-free perfect number is 6.[40]


In number theory, a practical number or panarithmic number[1] is a positive integer n such that all smaller positive integers can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of n. For example, 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: as well as these divisors themselves, we have 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 6 + 1, 8 = 6 + 2, 9 = 6 + 3, 10 = 6 + 3 + 1, and 11 = 6 + 3 + 2.

The sequence of practical numbers (sequence A005153 in the OEIS) begins

    1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 64, 66, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 120, 126, 128, 132, 140, 144, 150.... 
Every even perfect number and every power of two is also a practical number.

Practical numbers have also been shown to be analogous with prime numbers in many of their properties.
